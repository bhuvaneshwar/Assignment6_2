1.Why MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming?

	- Highly used for optimising with several stage of processing.

	- Map reduce is used when hadoop developers require driver program control.

	- It is of high use during the testability is required for combining large volume of data.

	-It is used when there is a need of cross products, joins and distributed cache by the job when there is a tricky usage.




2.What are advantages of Pig over MapReduce?

	   - It is a data flow language that makes it easier to process and and analyze big data by building it on the top of hadoop.

           - In map reduce the development time is high and in pig the development time is decreased by proper maintanence of 
	     the programs.

           - For user who do not know how to write map reduce or SQL programs ,they can make use of pig program which are similar 
	     to that of english language.

           - Pig is a procedural and therefore user can easily control the execution of steps.

           - Pig helps parallellization by acting as a base pipeline and utilize large volume of data.





3.What is Pig engine and what is its importance?

	- Huge set of data is represented in the form of dataflow.

	- It acts as abstraction over map reduce.

	- They execute hadoop jobs in mapreduce.

	- It is high level platform used to create programs which  run on hadoop.




4. What are the modes of Pig execution?

	* Local Mode
	* Mapreduce Mode

	* Local Mode:
	
		- Firstly installation of files takes place.

		- The installed files are made to run on local host and local file system

		- Local mode helps for test purposes.

	* Mapreduce Mode:

		- The data in the hdsf are processsed in mapreduce mode.

		- The data are processed using the pig latin statements.

		- Particular operations on data are performed by mapreduce job at back end.




5.What is Grunt Shell in Pig?

	- Grunt shell runs the pig scripts which is invoked by pig command.

	- this shell is used to write pig latinscripts.

	- Many shell and utility command use grunt shell.

	- Grunt supports documents which are use in batch processing and interactive mode.

	- Grunt can also be used with dfs commands .




6.What are the features of Pig Latin language?

	- It provides greater extensibility allowing the user for developing their own function to read and write data.

	- Pig latin handles both the structured and unstructured data.

	- Pig is a multi query approach thus helps the user to reduce the length of codes.

	- It provides rich set of operators

	- Pig is a SQL like language and it makes it easy to write code.

	- It provides optimization opportunity





7.Is Pig Latin commands case sensitive?

	- Yes,the pig latin commands are case sensitive.

	- Everything like The name of pig latin function ,the names of parameters and pig latin keywords are case sensitive.

	- Relation and field names are case sensitive.




8.What is a data flow language?

	- It is a programming concept that makes use of a directed graph.

	- Directed graph is made up of programs and the graph represents the flow of data between operations.

	- user is provided with stream of data that allows the user to move from instruction to instruction.
	
	- Conditional statement,jumps and procedural calls help user to move from instruction to instruction.
